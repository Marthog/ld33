tower defense:
You don't just passively fight by building things but control hords of monsters that defend against a few elite heroes.


Outposts: see the enemy before he reaches your base

Drummer: mobilize your troops and give them moral

orcs: masses

Commanders: taller orcs equipped with heroes' weapons

trolls: can break through walls, throw stones, block entries

fighter trolls: just very strong
